# ðŸ‘‹ heya, im lifeline4603

im a creative retarded autistic stupid annoying "developer" that has an interest in engineering, game hacking, cybersecurity, video editing and graphics design.

though i dont see myself as a talented developer, i still see value in some of the stuff i do, which is why i upload it publicly to github.

see a few of my popular repositories in this list:
