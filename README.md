im a creative retarded autistic stupid annoying "developer" that has an interest in engineering, game hacking, cybersecurity, video editing and graphics design.

though i dont see myself as a talented developer, i still see value in some of the stuff i do, which is why i upload it publicly to github.

see a few of my popular repositories in this list:
- [prop-skill-script-oink.lua](https://github.com/lifeline4603/prop-kill-script-oink.lua)
- [chat-spammer-gmod](https://github.com/lifeline4603/chat-spammer-gmod)

projects im actively working on:
- [ampel-microbit](https://github.com/lifeline4603/ampel-microbit)
- skibidiware (private repo)

*please note that ampel-microbit is a school project, which is why its mostly in german.*
